This repository is a skeleton for the Flask web application that we'll build during the [Cognitive Service workshop for Camp 2019](https://erhopf.github.io/camp2019/).

## The goal
The goal is to demonstrate how a developer may use different Cognitive Services together to create a delightful
experience for customers.

In this app we're using text translation, sentiment analysis, and text-to-speech. [Test it out!](https://translator-tts-demo.azurewebsites.net/)
